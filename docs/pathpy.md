# Higher-order Network Analysis with pathpy

This tutorial gives an introduction to the python Open Source data analytics package `pathpy`.

`pathpy` uses higher-order network models to analyze and visualize time-series data on complex networks. Examples include time-stamped social networks, temporal proximity data, traces on flow processes in networks, passenger itineraries in transportation networks, user click streams in the Web, citation networks, or biological pathway data. Building on the higher- and multi-order statistical modelling framework introduced in [[1]](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140924/ncomms6024/full/ncomms6024.html) and [[2]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098145), `pathpy` offers machine learning techniques to select optimal, higher-order network models for your data. It then uses these models to detect, model, and visualize higher-order dependencies and patterns discarded by standard network models.

The following video gives a high-level explanation of the ideas behind `pathpy`:

This interactive tutorial introduces the theoretical foundations of `pathpy` and uses empirical and synthetic data to show how they can be practically applied in `python`. The latest release of `pathpy` is available via the [python package index](https://pypi.org/project/pathpy2/). In python 3.x, you can install it by typing:

```
pip install pathpy2
```

`pathpy` is fully integrated with `jupyter`, providing in-line, interactive and dynamic visualisations of graphs, temporal networks, as well as higher- and multi-order network models. This teaser highlights some of its features:

A description of the [recommended setup](https://ingoscholtes.github.io/mathplus2022-tutorial/setup) to complete this tutorial is available [online](https://ingoscholtes.github.io/mathplus2022-tutorial/setup). A brief introduction to interactive data science with `python`, `Visual Studio Code`, and `jupyter` is given in [unit 1](https://github.com/IngoScholtes/mathplus2022-tutorial/blob/master/code/1_vscode_jupyter.py).

`pathpy` is brought to you by the Chair of Machine Learning for Complex Networks at [University of WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ml4nets/).

Feel free to [get in touch](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ml4nets/) if you want to host an interaction hands-on tutorial in your research group or institute.
