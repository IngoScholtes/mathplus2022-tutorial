This repository, contains material for the interactive tutorial that accompanies the lecture **From Networks to Optimal Higher-Order Models of Complex Systems** held at the MATH+ Summer School in Berlin.

[Step-by-step setup instructions](https://IngoScholtes.github.io/mathplus2022-tutorial/setup) can be found on the [tutorial website](https://IngoScholtes.github.io/mathplus2022-tutorial/).

While you can manually download all necessary files, we strongly recommend to clone this repository to obtain a local, synchronised copy of all material via `git`. Assuming you have a local `git` installation, you can do this as follows:  

`git clone https://github.com/IngoScholtes/mathplus2022-tutorial`

If you don't have `git` installed already, here you can find information on [how to set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).
